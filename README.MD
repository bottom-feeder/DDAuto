# DDAuto

Dynamic DNS with AutoDNS

DDAuto is a simple REST-service for dynamic DNS. It uses the API of AutoDNS to update the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of sub domains and can be used with many routers, for example the AVM Fritz!Box.
DDAuto is written with [spring boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot) and can be executed by `commandline`, `init.d` or `systemd`.
